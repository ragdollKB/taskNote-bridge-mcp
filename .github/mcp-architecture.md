# MCP Architecture & Concepts

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables secure connections between AI applications and external data sources. It provides a unified way for AI assistants to access real-time information and execute actions across different tools and systems.

## Core Architecture

### Three-Layer Architecture

1. **MCP Hosts (AI Applications)**
   - Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, Continue, Zed
   - Initiate connections to MCP servers
   - Send requests and handle responses
   - Manage the user interface and experience

2. **MCP Clients (within Hosts)**
   - Handle MCP protocol communication
   - Manage connections to multiple servers
   - Route requests and responses
   - Implement security and authentication

3. **MCP Servers (Data/Tool Providers)**
   - Expose specific capabilities (tools, resources, prompts)
   - Connect to external systems and databases
   - Process requests from MCP clients
   - Return structured data and results

## Key Concepts

### Resources
Static or dynamic content that servers can provide to clients:
- **File contents**: Documents, code, configuration files
- **Database records**: User data, application state
- **API responses**: Real-time data from external services
- **Generated content**: Dynamic reports, summaries

### Tools
Executable functions that clients can invoke:
- **Data operations**: Create, read, update, delete
- **External actions**: Send emails, create calendar events
- **System commands**: File operations, process management
- **Custom logic**: Business-specific operations

### Prompts
Pre-defined prompt templates with placeholders:
- **Reusable templates**: Common query patterns
- **Parameterized prompts**: Dynamic content insertion
- **Structured workflows**: Multi-step processes
- **Context-aware prompts**: Adaptive based on current state

### Sampling
Controlled text generation capabilities:
- **Content generation**: Create text with specific constraints
- **Template completion**: Fill in structured formats
- **Data transformation**: Convert between formats
- **Quality control**: Guided generation with validation

## Transport Mechanisms

### Standard I/O (stdio)
- **Local communication**: Process-to-process on same machine
- **Simple setup**: No network configuration required
- **High performance**: Direct process communication
- **Security**: Isolated to local machine

### HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Remote communication**: Network-based connections
- **Web compatibility**: Standard HTTP protocol
- **Real-time updates**: Server-sent events for notifications
- **Scalability**: Multiple clients, load balancing

## Security Model

### Connection Security
- **Authentication**: Verify client and server identity
- **Authorization**: Control access to specific capabilities
- **Encryption**: Protect data in transit (HTTPS, TLS)
- **Isolation**: Sandbox server operations

### Capability-Based Access
- **Selective exposure**: Servers expose only needed functionality
- **Granular permissions**: Fine-grained access control
- **Runtime validation**: Check permissions per request
- **Audit logging**: Track access and operations

## Protocol Flow

### Connection Lifecycle
1. **Initialization**: Client discovers and connects to server
2. **Capability negotiation**: Exchange supported features
3. **Authentication**: Verify permissions and access rights
4. **Operation**: Handle requests and responses
5. **Termination**: Clean shutdown and resource cleanup

### Request-Response Pattern
1. **Client request**: JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted message
2. **Server processing**: Validate, execute, prepare response
3. **Server response**: Structured result or error
4. **Client handling**: Process response, update UI

## Implementation Patterns

### Server Design Patterns
- **Stateless operations**: Each request is independent
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error reporting
- **Resource management**: Efficient use of system resources
- **Concurrent handling**: Support multiple simultaneous requests

### Client Integration Patterns
- **Connection pooling**: Reuse connections efficiently
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Handle server unavailability
- **Caching strategies**: Store responses when appropriate
- **User experience**: Smooth integration with host application

## Benefits

### For AI Applications
- **Enhanced capabilities**: Access to real-time, contextual data
- **Standardized integration**: Common protocol across tools
- **Reduced complexity**: No custom integration per service
- **Better user experience**: Seamless access to external tools

### For Data Providers
- **Broader reach**: Connect to multiple AI applications
- **Standard implementation**: Use common protocol and patterns
- **Security control**: Maintain control over data access
- **Future compatibility**: Evolve with protocol standards

### For Developers
- **Faster integration**: Standard patterns and libraries
- **Reduced maintenance**: Common protocol reduces complexity
- **Better testing**: Standard tools and practices
- **Community support**: Shared knowledge and resources

## Ecosystem
