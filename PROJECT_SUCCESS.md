- **Threading Excellence**: Solved complex Swift async/SwiftUI/stdio integration

## ‚úÖ Major Technical Victories

### 1. Threading/Concurrency Resolution ‚úÖ
**SOLVED**: Complex Swift async/await + SwiftUI + stdio integration challenges
- ‚úÖ No more crashes in stdio mode
- ‚úÖ Proper command line argument handling in SwiftUI app lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Background thread execution for MCP server operations
- ‚úÖ Clean separation between GUI and stdio modes

### 2. Complete MCP Protocol Implementation ‚úÖ
**WORKING**: Full JSON-RPC 2.0 + MCP specification compliance
- ‚úÖ Initialize requests with proper capabilities negotiation
- ‚úÖ Tools discovery and listing (9 tools total)
- ‚úÖ Tool execution with structured responses and error handling

### 3. Comprehensive Application Integration ‚úÖ
**FUNCTIONAL**: Both target applications fully integrated with native quality
- ‚úÖ **Things 3**: 7 tools (add-todo, add-project, search-todos, get-today, get-upcoming, get-projects, open-todo)
- ‚úÖ **Apple Notes**: 3 tools (notes-create, notes-search, notes-list) 
- ‚úÖ All tools with complete JSON schemas and parameter validation
- ‚úÖ Native AppleScript integration for seamless app interaction

## üß™ Live Testing Results - ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL ‚úÖ
