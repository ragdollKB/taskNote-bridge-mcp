## üèóÔ∏è **Project Architecture**

This project provides **two MCP server implementations** for different use cases:

### üì± **TaskNote Bridge.app** (GUI Application)
- **Purpose**: macOS app with visual monitoring interface
- **Transport**: TCP server (port 8000) for network-based connections
- **Features**: Real-time dashboard, connection monitoring, log viewer
- **Use Case**: When you want visual monitoring of server activity
- **Launch**: Open the app from Applications folder

### üìü **swift_mcp_stdio.swift** (Command-Line Server)  
- **Purpose**: Lightweight stdio-based MCP server
- **Transport**: Standard input/output communication
- **Features**: Direct JSON-RPC message handling, minimal overhead
- **Use Case**: **Recommended for Claude Desktop** and most MCP clients
- **Launch**: Via `launch_swift_mcp_stdio.sh` script

### üîß **Which One to Use?**

| MCP Client | Recommended Server | Configuration |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Claude Desktop** | ‚úÖ stdio script | `command: "/path/to/launch_swift_mcp_stdio.sh"` |
| **VS Code MCP** | ‚úÖ stdio script | Same as Claude Desktop |
| **Custom TCP client** | üì± GUI app | Connect to `localhost:8000` |
| **Development/Testing** | üì± GUI app | Visual monitoring + TCP access |

> **üí° Key Point**: Most MCP clients (including Claude Desktop) expect stdio-based communication, not TCP connections.

## üîó MCP Client Connection Guide

TaskNote Bridge supports multiple connection methods to work with various MCP clients. Choose the method that works best for your client:

### üéØ Claude Desktop

**Configure Claude Desktop** to use the stdio-based MCP server:

1. **Open Claude Desktop**
2. **Click the settings gear (‚öôÔ∏è)** in the bottom left
3. **Select "Developer"**
4. **In the "MCP Servers" section, click "Edit Config"**
5. **Add this configuration**:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "tasknote-bridge": {
            "command": "/path/to/tasknote-bridge/launch_swift_mcp_stdio.sh"
        }
    }
}
```

> **üìù Note**: Replace `/path/to/tasknote-bridge/` with your actual installation directory. Common paths:
> - **Downloaded release**: `/Users/[username]/Downloads/tasknote-bridge/launch_swift_mcp_stdio.sh`
> - **Cloned repository**: `/Users/[username]/Projects/tasknote-bridge/launch_swift_mcp_stdio.sh`
> - **App bundle install**: `/Applications/TaskNote Bridge.app/Contents/Resources/launch_swift_mcp_stdio.sh` ```

6. **Save the configuration**
7. **Restart Claude Desktop** to apply the changes

> **‚úÖ Success**: Claude Desktop will now connect via stdio transport, which is the recommended and most reliable method for MCP communication.

### üîß VS Code with MCP Extension

1. **Install the MCP extension** for VS Code:
   - Open VS Code Extensions (Cmd+Shift+X)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Claude Desktop Connection Issues

#### "Request timed out" / Server not responding
If Claude Desktop shows timeout errors or doesn't receive responses:

**‚ùå Incorrect Configuration (causes timeouts):**
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "tasknote-bridge": {
            "command": "nc",
            "args": ["localhost", "8000"]
        }
    }
}
```

**‚úÖ Correct Configuration:**
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "tasknote-bridge": {
            "command": "/path/to/tasknote-bridge/launch_swift_mcp_stdio.sh"
        }
    }
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- Claude Desktop expects **stdio-based communication** (launching a subprocess)
- The `nc localhost 8000` approach tries to use TCP through netcat, which doesn't properly handle MCP protocol initialization
- The stdio script provides proper JSON-RPC message handling that Claude Desktop requires

**To fix:**
1. Update your Claude Desktop configuration to use the stdio script
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. The connection should now work without timeouts

#### Verify the server works
Test the stdio server directly:
```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0.0"}}}' | /path/to/tasknote-bridge/launch_swift_mcp_stdio.sh
```

You should see an immediate response like:
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"serverInfo":{"name":"things-mcp-swift","version":"1.0.0"},"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{"tools":{}}}}
```
