2. **Test the setup script** on a clean system
3. **Verify all tools work** with the new configuration approach
4. **Build and test TaskNote Bridge.app** using Xcode
5. **Push to public repository** with clean commit history
6. **Tag a release version** (e.g., v1.0.0)

### User Installation Flow:
1. `git clone https://github.com/ragdollKB/taskNote-bridge-mcp`
2. `cd taskNote-bridge-mcp`
3. `uv venv && uv pip install -e .`
4. `uv run python setup_config.py`
5. Follow the configuration instructions
6. **Optional**: Build TaskNote Bridge.app using Xcode for GUI monitoring
7. `uv run python test_server.py` to verify

The codebase is now ready for public release with no personal or computer-specific configurations!
